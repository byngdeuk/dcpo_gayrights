### Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion

The study of comparative public opinion has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both.  This paper presents a method for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion across countries.  It illustrates the value of this approach by examining the reciprocal relationships between public opinion regarding homosexuality and the legal recognition of same-sex unions.
