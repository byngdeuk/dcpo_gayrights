DCPO: Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion
=========

The study of comparative public opinion across countries has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both.  `DCPO` is an R package for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine  the dynamics of public opinion across countries.
