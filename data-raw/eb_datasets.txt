Erico's question for Fred:
5/26:
(1)in eb35a, survey uses nation ID NATION II, in which Northern Ireland is excluded; thus NATION II is uncontinous(1:9 and 11:14);
how should I code it in order to merge with the data? 
data_frame(v6 = 1:13, c_dcpo = c("FRANCE", "BELGIUM", "NETHERLANDS", "WEST GERMANY", "ITALY", "LUXEMBOURG", "DENMARK", "IREAND", "GREAT BRITAIN", "GREECE", "SPAIN", "PORTUGAL", "EAST GERMANY"), y_dcpo=1991)

(2)can you double check this line and see whether I do it correctly? In eb17, all countries are applied with 6 different weights for different sets of questions (not by countries, thus cannot separate weight by countries)
: v7 National Weight I-Stand Cross, V8 European Weight-Stand Cross, v9 National Weight I-Youth Sample, V10 European Weight-Youth Sample, 
v11 National Weight I-Combination, and V12 European Weight-Combination

(3)Need clarification: (1)from eb 34, "East" and "West Germany"; there are only three nation ID: (united UK and separate Germany; separate UK and separate Germany; 
and separate UK and united Germany); which one do we use for the data frame?




Eurobarometer

1. Set up a Gesis account
2. download each codebook (and maybe file)
3. build a load_cmd with
	eb05 <- read_dta(paste0(datapath, "gesis_files/ZA0989/ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta"))
*Erico: in haven, the code should be: read_dta(path)
	a. survey name (eb05)
	b. uid (ZA0989)
	c. file name (ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta)
4. build cy_data by looking at codebook
	data_frame(v4 = 1:10, c_dcpo = c("France", "Belgium", "Netherlands", "Germany", "Italy", "Luxembourg", "Denmark", "Ireland", "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom"), y_dcpo = 1976)
	a. first variable is the dataset's variable that identifies countries (v4 here)
	b. then c_dcpo is vector of country names
	c. then y_dcpo is the year of the survey



5. find wt variable
	EB often offers multiple weights; follow examples
	I want united Germany (where available) and UK (rather than GB and NI)
	separate commands with semicolons



Erico's Notes about weights:
1. two weights for UK(v6 National Weight and v7 UK weight); for example, eb10

2. [NEED HELP] (1) In eb17, all countries are applied with 6 different weights for different sets of questions (not by countries, thus cannot separate weight by countries)
: v7 National Weight I-Stand Cross, V8 European Weight-Stand Cross, v9 National Weight I-Youth Sample, V10 European Weight-Youth Sample, 
v11 National Weight I-Combination, and V12 European Weight-Combination

(2) from eb17, weighting factor for the U.K. is embedded in the National Weight; 

*Erico: the NATION WEIGHT I=UK Weight; 
        the EUROPEAN WEIGHT= adjusts each sample in proportion of tis share in the total population, aged 15 and over, 
of the European Comunity as a whole in its respective composition.

3. EB32(ZA1752): two Euro Weight; Euro Weight I: the same as Euro Weight Before; Euro Weight II:does not include Spain and Portugal(weighted as 0)       


4.[NEED CLARIFICATION]:
(1)from eb 34, "East" and "West Germany"; there are only three nation ID: (united UK and separate Germany; separate UK and separate Germany; 
and separate UK and united Germany); which one do we use for the data frame?
(2)unlike the "Nation Weight I" in earlier eb (up to 31), the weight adjusts all samples to the standard size
also, Norway is excluded (weighted as 0)


5.[NEED DOUBLE CHECK]
eb35A, neither normal "Nation Weight I" nor "Weight Special United Kingdom" in eb 34; there is only v7, "Weight_A Result from Target", 
but it corresponds to "Nation Weight II" in earlier Eb up to 31
