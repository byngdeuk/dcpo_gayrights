Eurobarometer

1. Set up a Gesis account
2. download each codebook (and maybe file)
3. build a load_cmd with
	eb05 <- read_dta(paste0(datapath, "gesis_files/ZA0989/ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta"))
*Erico: in haven, the code should be: read_dta(path)
	a. survey name (eb05)
	b. uid (ZA0989)
	c. file name (ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta)
4. build cy_data by looking at codebook
	data_frame(v4 = 1:10, c_dcpo = c("France", "Belgium", "Netherlands", "Germany", "Italy", "Luxembourg", "Denmark", "Ireland", "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom"), y_dcpo = 1976)
	a. first variable is the dataset's variable that identifies countries (v4 here)
	b. then c_dcpo is vector of country names
	c. then y_dcpo is the year of the survey
5. find wt variable
	EB often offers multiple weights; follow examples
	I want united Germany (where available) and UK (rather than GB and NI)
	separate commands with semicolons
6. fill in source and uid
