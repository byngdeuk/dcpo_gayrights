Eurobarometer

1. Set up a Gesis account
2. download each codebook (and maybe file)
3. build a load_cmd with
	eb05 <- read_dta(paste0(datapath, "gesis_files/ZA0989/ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta"))
*Erico: in haven, the code should be: read_dta(path)
	a. survey name (eb05)
	b. uid (ZA0989)
	c. file name (ZA0989_v1-0-1.dta)
4. build cy_data by looking at codebook
	data_frame(v4 = 1:10, c_dcpo = c("France", "Belgium", "Netherlands", "Germany", "Italy", "Luxembourg", "Denmark", "Ireland", "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom"), y_dcpo = 1976)
	a. first variable is the dataset's variable that identifies countries (v4 here)
	b. then c_dcpo is vector of country names
	c. then y_dcpo is the year of the survey
5. find wt variable
	EB often offers multiple weights; follow examples
	I want united Germany (where available) and UK (rather than GB and NI)
	separate commands with semicolons



Erico's Notes about weights:
1. two weights for UK(v6 National Weight and v7 UK weight); for example, eb10

2. [NEED HELP] 
(1) In eb17, all countries are applied with 6 different weights for different sets of questions (not by countries, thus cannot separate weight by countries)
: v7 National Weight I-Stand Cross, V8 European Weight-Stand Cross, v9 National Weight I-Youth Sample, V10 European Weight-Youth Sample, 
v11 National Weight I-Combination, and V12 European Weight-Combination

(2) from eb17, weighting factor for the U.K. is embedded in the National Weight; 

*Erico: the NATION WEIGHT I=UK Weight; 
        the EUROPEAN WEIGHT= adjusts each sample in proportion of tis share in the total population, aged 15 and over, 
of the European Comunity as a whole in its respective composition.
